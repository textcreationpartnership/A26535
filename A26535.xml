            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Is commonly acknowledged by learned men, that <hi>Aeſops Fables,</hi> or the Book ſo called, is one of the <hi>wiſeſt,</hi> as well as <hi>pleaſanteſt moral</hi> books of its bigneſs, in the world. [It was ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally read in old time as that it became a Proverb when they would ſay ſuch a one was a very <hi>Idiot,</hi> or <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> to ſay to him <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, thou haſt not yet read <hi>Aeſop.</hi> [That it is commonly read in Grammar Schools ought to be taken for no diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to it, ſeeing the like may be ſaid of <hi>Tullie's Offices,</hi> a book of ſo profound wiſdome, that a famous <hi>Privy Counſel-Ior</hi> to <hi>Qu. Elizabeth</hi> is ſaid to have always carried it about him. [Men, and children, may read the ſame books, but for different ends and purpoſes. Men may read thoſe books for their <hi>Profundity</hi> which Children read for their <hi>pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Or men may read the ſame books for their Solidity wiſdome, and Judgment, which is in them, which children
<pb facs="tcp:96871:4"/>are taught meerly for their fancy, ſtile, and language. [Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the famous <hi>Oglesby</hi> had never provided ſo elaborate a Tranſlation for but one hundred and twenty Fables, or thereabouts, or found encouragement to print but ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in two volumes, with excellent Sculptures at a very great charge, and price, if notwithſtandlng the ſeeming proſtitution of that book to the uſe of children, it had not had a very great eſteem, amongſt the wiſer ſort of mankind. [I am bold to ſay it is not beneath the wiſeſt and beſt man in the world to read <hi>Aeſops Fables.</hi> Elſe why are they frequently quoted by one of the greateſt Oracles for Learning, and wiſdome, that ever England, if not the world, had, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Lord Verulam,</hi> in his <hi>Eſſayes,</hi> and other of his excellent writings? [More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over I could give inſtance of ſeveral Fables which, as their own <hi>Morals</hi> do conſtrue them,
<note place="margin">Ex Gr. Fab. 194. and Fab. 218.</note> are of a very <hi>pious,</hi> and <hi>religious</hi> import, (as almoſt all the reſt are very grave prudent, and ſober,) and thence it was that I have preſumed to ſay it would not misbecome, or diſhonour the <hi>beſt,</hi> as well as the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> man in the world to read what <hi>Aeſop</hi> has written.</p>
            <p>It has been ſaid that though a perſon by the name of <hi>Aeſop,</hi> was doubtleſs the Author of ſome of thoſe Fables which go by his name, yet that the book which we call <hi>Aeſop's Fable</hi> (though they were not all his) is a kind of <hi>Syſtem</hi> or <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dect,</hi> of the choiceſt Obſervations of ſeveral Ages, delivered to the world by way of <hi>Fables.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly <hi>Aeſop's Fables</hi> is a book not only to be read, and contemplated but to be followed and practis'd; and may ſerve to guide and govern our civil, domeſtical, and political affairs, (in many caſes) as the Marriners compaſs doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his Steerage, and conduct his voyage.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to ſay that a due obſervation of ſome few Fables in this little book, I mean a due compliance with the wiſe directions therein given, had preſerved divers individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb facs="tcp:96871:4"/>perſons, and not only perſons but Families, not only Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies but kingdomes, and nations, from thoſe courſes which have proved to be their ruine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Socrates</hi> that great Morall Philoſopher (who in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Apollo</hi> was the wiſeſt man on earth) but a little before his death, tranſlated one or more of <hi>Aeſops Fables</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Greek verſe.</p>
            <p>All which things conſider'd no mans Profeſſion can be too grave, ſolemn or ſacred to permit him the reading, tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or improving of <hi>Aeſops Fables.</hi> Yet I my ſelf, I think, ſhould hardly have done it, had I not been conſtrained to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern my ſelf for ſome time with the education of youth, and thereby invited to it, both for their advantage, and my own diverſion. [True it is that Mr. <hi>Oglesby</hi> hath helpt the world to a Tranſlation of ſome part of <hi>Aeſops Fables,</hi> which is incomparably good; for ſuch as can reach the ſenſe and price of it, but certainly to underſtand ſo lofty a Poem as that is, requires a better capacity, and more skill in Poetical phraſes, and Fictions, than the generality of thoſe who are willing to read <hi>Aeſop's Fables</hi> are endowed with. And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the price of his two excellent Folio's upon <hi>Aeſop,</hi> doth as much exceed moſt mens purſes, as the Style and language thereof doth their capacities. [Moreover there are not above one hundred and thirty two Fables of that excellent Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereas the book which is now in thy hand containeth about three hundred and fifty.</p>
            <p>I have turned the ſame number of Fables into Latine <hi>Hexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter</hi> and <hi>Pentameter.</hi> If that verſion by a tollerable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of this ſhall receive encouragement to come forth into the world, I purpoſe that the numbers of both of them ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly anſwer each to other, that with ſo much more eaſe and expedition they may be read together by ſuch as ſhall deſire it.</p>
            <p>The Advantages which I have aim'd at in turning <hi>Aeſops Fables</hi> into verſe are firſt to fix the contents thereof more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delibly
<pb facs="tcp:96871:5"/>upon the minds, and memories of ſuch as ſhall read them, common experience ſhewing us that it is eaſier for men (to be ſure for children) to remember <hi>Metre,</hi> than <hi>Proſe;</hi> For that reaſon I ſuppoſe it was that <hi>Lilly,</hi> and ſeveral other Grammarians have put divers of their Rules into Verſe. Secondly, To inſinuate the excellent ſenſe and grave counſels, therein contain'd into the minds of old and young with more delight and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>As for the Morals of each Fable I have generally kept to thoſe which are annex'd to the Fables in Latine (as ſeeming to be moſt authentick) but where I found any moral (as I thought) ſhort and defective, I have taken the liberty to add to it, where dark and obſcure, I have laboured to explain it, and where I found the ſame Morals repeated over and over, I have preſented thee with ſome variety, which I hope may render the work more profitable, than it would otherwiſe have been, as the putting of it into metre with ſome little admix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of humour and fancy, (at leaſtwiſe attempted) was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to render it more <hi>pleaſant.</hi> [This is generally printed as correctly as other Engliſh books are, but here and there a fault has eſcap'd the preſs which hath perverted the ſenſe, and is ſuch as I am heartily aſham'd of, for which the beſt amends. I could make thee was to put ſuch miſtakes into a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>Errata</hi> where thou mayſt ſee them corrected. [I hope a ſmall Apology may ſerve; for having brought in <hi>Aeſop</hi> at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral turns ſpeaking like one of us, or according to the Engliſh mode and dialect, or uſing Expreſſions and Alluſions much more novel and modern, than was the time he liv'd in; for why ſhould that be more a <hi>Soleciſm</hi> than to make him ſpeak <hi>Engliſh?</hi> (which was never his language) or by what means could we cauſe his drift and ſcope to be better underſtood by Engliſh men? (who beſt apprehend and are moſt pleaſed with their own Idioms) moreover I think our ſo doing is very juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable by the Figure <hi>Proſopopeia</hi> which is greatly uſual
<pb facs="tcp:96871:5"/>amongſt thoſe whoſe way of writing is any thing towards <hi>Burleſque.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have heard of a maſter, who told one that was his Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that he would never be able ſufficiently to requite him for that he firſt taught him to know the worth of <hi>Horace.</hi> I am bold to ſay he that ſhall bring any perſon to know the worth of <hi>Aeſops Fables</hi> ſo as to make the beſt uſe that may be made thereof, ſhall by that oblige and ſerve him altogether as much, as he did his pupil who brought him in love with <hi>Horace.</hi> For he that ſhall ſteer his courſe by the wiſe directions given in <hi>Aeſops Fables,</hi> will be thought by them that know him, to be as <hi>prudent,</hi> as <hi>Aeſop</hi> himſelf was wiſe and witty. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it is at thy choice in what language (of thoſe thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeſt) thou wilt read <hi>Aeſop</hi> (for I think he is in moſt) or whether thou wilt read him in <hi>Verſe,</hi> or in <hi>Proſe,</hi> and if in verſe, whether in this Tranſlation, or in another [only <hi>150</hi> of theſe Fables I think thou canſt not find tranſlated into Engliſh metre, any where elſe) but one way or other thou ſhould'ſt read <hi>Aeſop</hi> over and over, if I were worthy to adviſe thee; Let thy <hi>Sex, Capacity, Quality,</hi> (I was about to add <hi>profeſſion,</hi> or <hi>Age)</hi> be what it will be, and be guided by him as an Oracle in many caſes, which being done, I have little doubt, but <hi>Aeſop</hi> may leave thee both <hi>wiſer</hi> and <hi>better</hi> than he found thee.</p>

                  <l>Spider whom Pride no leſs than poiſon ſwells,</l>
                  <l>Thought rich mens houſes were the only cells</l>
                  <l>Fit for a perſon of his quality,</l>
                  <l>And told the Gout e'ne quarter there will I.</l>
                  <l>There he ſet up his looms and fell to work,</l>
                  <l>Was ſo ſecure, he fear'd nor Pope nor Turk;</l>
                  <l>There he was weaving webs, had great affinity,</l>
                  <l>With airy Schoolmens over-nice divinity:</l>

                  <l>Then he his quarters could not longer keep.</l>
                  <l>For to give over working he is made,</l>
                  <l>Though once there was an Emperor of his trade;</l>
                  <l>He meets with many a bruſh, and many a check,</l>
                  <l>Scap'd narrowly the breaking of his neck.</l>
                  <l>Thrown down from high roof'd houſes like <hi>Pauls-ſteeple,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Sorely affronted before all the people;</l>
                  <l>The Gout was got into a poor mans hutch,</l>
                  <l>There the tormentor was tormented much.</l>
                  <l>Truth is, was almoſt ſtarv'd, nor bed nor board</l>
                  <l>Fit for ſo tender gueſt, he could afford:</l>
                  <l>Like priſoner he was fed with bread and water,</l>
                  <l>Laid upon boards and ſtraw, enough to ſlaughter</l>
                  <l>One that had limbs as ſoft as any ſilk,</l>
                  <l>That call'd for Poulteſſes of bread and milk;</l>
                  <l>They were ſo ſore with great pain and hard travel,</l>
                  <l>But there he lay as he had lain on gravel.</l>
                  <l>Spider and Gout the next day met again</l>
                  <l>And told ſad ſtories, where they each had lain,</l>

                  <l>Such as were told before, thought how they might</l>
                  <l>Their quarters mend, before another night.</l>
                  <l>Vexation which doth underſtanding give,</l>
                  <l>Told them that ſpiders muſt with poor men live;</l>
                  <l>The Gout with rich, Spiders were ſafe in Hutches,</l>
                  <l>And Gouts us'd kindly when in rich mens clutches;</l>
                  <l>They did but ſhift their lodgings both were well,</l>
                  <l>And better how to be they could not tell.</l>
                  <l>The Gout went next into a rich mans hall,</l>
                  <l>And found the maſter very complemental:</l>
                  <l>Though he came limping in, not like a Cripple</l>
                  <l>Was he there us'd, the Maſter far from gripple</l>
                  <l>He found towards him, he ſpar'd for no coſt</l>
                  <l>As who ſhould ſay he fear'd he might have loſt</l>
                  <l>So good a gueſt, had he not been ſo kind,</l>
                  <l>But always to enjoy him was his mind.</l>
                  <l>If hold him by the teeth he might to eat</l>
                  <l>He ſhould not grudg him, the beſt of all meat.</l>

                  <l>(If <hi>Claret</hi> and red-herring cure a cold,</l>
                  <l>And hoarſeneſs, Gout with <hi>Claret</hi> may be bold)</l>
                  <l>'Twere endleſs to tell all, but in a word,</l>
                  <l>The rich man us'd his Gout like any Lord.</l>
                  <l>The Spider in his Cottage ſped as well,</l>
                  <l>He to the Gout when they next meet did tell;</l>
                  <l>(Perhaps it was a Brother weavers ſtye,</l>

                  <l>He ſaid his Landlord kept no mighty table,</l>
                  <l>For being poor ſaid he, he is not able:</l>

                  <l>Let me but have my belly full of flies.</l>
                  <l>For they are meat and cloth as all can tell</l>
